# Lode-Runner-2
This experiment was to see if I could make an entire playable game in HTA, but small enough to post on a forum (in one post I mean).

The Windows only game is based on LodeRunner.....Collect diamonds whilst traversing ladders and avoiding three meanies. The only advantage you have is you can fall off ladders, they can't.
